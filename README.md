# DATA-ANALYTICS

Data analytics (DA) is the process of examining data sets in order to find trends and draw conclusions about the information they contain. Increasingly data analytics is used with the aid of specialized systems and software. Data analytics technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial industries to enable organizations to make more-informed business decisions. It is also used scientists and researchers to verify or disprove scientific models, theories and hypotheses.

Data analytics initiatives can help businesses increase revenues, improve operational efficiency, optimize marketing campaigns and customer service efforts. It can also be used to respond quickly to emerging market trends and gain a competitive edge over rivals. The ultimate goal of data analytics, however, is boosting business performance. Depending on the particular application, the data that's analyzed can consist of either historical records or new information that have been processed for real-time analytics. In addition, it can come from a mix of internal systems and external data sources.

DA-1(GENERAL FUNCTIONS)(CSV FILE USED: sales.csv)
The File Contains the Introduction to Data Analytics and Basic Fumctions Used While Analysing the Data. Some General Functions are:
1. Head : The head () method in python contains only one parameter, which is n. It is an optional parameter. By setting it, we fix the number of rows we want from the DataFrame. The head () function returns n rows from the DataFrame. 

2. Shape : shape() is use in pandas to give number of row/column.

3. Columns : columns is used to display the Columns in the data.

4. dtypes : dtypes is used to Print Data Type of the Columns in the Data.

5. info : info() function is used to get a concise summary of the dataframe. It comes really handy when doing exploratory analysis of the data.

6. iLoc : iloc is used to extract an element based upon the position.

DA-2(CENTRAL TENDENCY AND DISPERSION)(CSV FILE USED: sales.csv)
This File Contains the Central Tendency and Dispersion Functions such as:
1. Mean : For a data set, the arithmetic mean, also called the expected value or average, is the central value of a discrete set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values. 

2. Median : The median is well-defined for any ordered (one-dimensional) data, and is independent of any distance metric. The median can thus be applied to classes which are ranked but not numerical (e.g. working out a median grade when students are graded from A to F), although the result might be halfway between classes if there is an even number of cases.

3. Mode : Mode is the value which occurs most frequently in a set of observations. For example, {6, 3, 9, 6, 6, 5, 9, 3} the Mode is 6, as it occurs most often.

4. Percentile : A percentile (or a centile) is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls.

5. Quartile : A quartile is a type of quantile which divides the number of data points into four more or less equal parts, or quarters. The first quartile (Q1) is defined as the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data set.

6. Inter Quartile Range : Interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread, middle 50%, or H‑spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles, IQR = Q3 − Q1.

7. Variance : Variance (σ 2) in statistics is a measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set.

8. Standard Deviation : Standard Deviation is a measure which shows how much variation (such as spread, dispersion, spread,) from the mean exists. The standard deviation indicates a “typical” deviation from the mean.

9. Population Standard Deviation : The population standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

10. Skewness : Skewness refers to distortion or asymmetry in a symmetrical bell curve, or normal distribution, in a set of data. If the curve is shifted to the left or to the right, it is said to be skewed.

11. Box Plot : A Box plot or boxplot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Box plots may also have lines extending from the boxes indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, hence the terms box-and-whisker plot and box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers may be plotted as individual points.
